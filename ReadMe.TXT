  What is it?
  -----------

	The Earthquake Explorer app is an event-based interface that offers users a 	single point-of-entry for access to USGS Earthquakes Hazards Program data as 	they become available in near-real time. Users can view and get information 	about earthquake events by time and magnitude. Queries based on spatial 		extent, defined by place-name or bounding box, can be applied to the data. 		Summary reports are generated for all earthquake events, along with the 		selected events in the user-defined area of interest, and are available for 	export. This application was created by Behzad Vahedi and Sara Lafia, 		GIScience graduate students at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
